                  Over many discussions and observations with Randy Schnarr and Charles Bailey we came up with a plan. The actual template was designed by our own Marine Heritage Volunteer Randy Schnarr. Kuhl Manufacturing has been involved with the needs of MHS for many years. The cannons which were designed for the General Hunter by Mike Sterling were produced at the Kuhl facility as well.

              <p class="prim-text">
                 In the past the crew would have to climb up on the ramp and unwind the winch in an awkward position. If all works as planned this procedure will occur without climbing and also from the safety of the main dock. The new winch will be located at the opposite end of the ramp, much closer to where it can be reached.
